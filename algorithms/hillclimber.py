def hill_climber(inventory, repetitions, constraint):
    '''
    Hillclimber algorithm with improves upon the solutions provided by the other algorithms.
    It accepts a new solutions when the parcel amount is higher. 

    Input:
            takes three input arguments: the class Inventory containing all information
            about the spaceships and parcels; the repetitions, how many iterations will be performed;
            constraint: whether or not there is a political constraint.

    Output: 
            returns a list of instances of the class Inventory, containing the solutions from 
            the algorithm which are better than the original provided solutions from the 
            other algorithms. The solutions contain the total parcel amount and the costs. 

    Usage:
