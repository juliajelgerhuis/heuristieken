    This script writes results to a csv file. A result is defined as a fleet 
    with a parcel distribution. Writes the following attributes:
        - (CSV-specific) solution id
        - Algorithm type
        - Hill Climber
        - Simulated Annealing
        - Diplomatic constraint
        - Number of iterations
        - Cargolist
        - Number of packages
        - Total costs
        - Total costs (as % of upper bound)
        - Percentage mass filled
        - Percentage volume filled
        - Parcel distribution

    Takes one argument:
        inventory: Object of type inventory.
