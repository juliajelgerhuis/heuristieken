Case: Space Freight <br />
http://heuristieken.nl/wiki/index.php?title=Space_Freight

## Main goal
Ship parcels to the International Space Station (ISS) using 4 spacecrafts.
Divide the parcels over the different ships to make it as cost efficient as possible.

## Structure of repository
Our repository consists of the following folders:
* Data: here you can find our cargolists and features of the spaceships
* Scripts: the algorithms
* Classes: here the spaceships classes are stored
* Calculations: calculation important for our algorithms are stored here
* Other: other files, like our to do list + division of tasks.

* Repository also contains a main.py file that will be used to run the program
  and call all other files

## Script
Libraries used:
* pandas: update numeric tables and time series

# Use of program
Right now we are only using one cargolist and a set of four spaceships.
Later, program will probably be run in main.py with "cargolist to use" and
"spaceship list to use" as command-line argument.
