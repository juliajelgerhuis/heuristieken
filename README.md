* Classes: here the spaceships classes are stored
* Calculations: calculation important for our algorithms are stored here
* Other: other files, like our to do list + division of tasks.

* Repository also contains a main.py file that will be used to call

## Script
Libraries used:
* pandas: update numeric tables and time series
