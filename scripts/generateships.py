    This script generates a fleet of ships that is large enough to hold all
    packages.

    Returns a list of objects of type Spaceship.

    Takes two arguments:

        inventory: Must contain object of type inventory.

        constraint: 
            True: Setting constraint to True will generate ships given that 
            nations must send an equal number of ships. The difference in the 
            number of ships each nation sends cannot be larger than one. 
            
            False: Setting constraint to False will disregard any diplomatic 
            constraints and will generate a fleet of ships at random.
